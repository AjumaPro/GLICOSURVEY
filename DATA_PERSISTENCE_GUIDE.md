# üìä Data Persistence & Recovery Guide

## üéØ Overview

The GLICO Survey application now implements **comprehensive data persistence** ensuring that all surveys, templates, and drafts are **permanently saved** unless explicitly deleted. This guide explains the new features and how they protect your data.

## üîí Key Features

### 1. **Soft Delete System**
- **Surveys, templates, and questions are never permanently deleted** by default
- **Soft delete** marks items as deleted but keeps them in the database
- **Recovery** is possible for accidentally deleted items
- **Audit trail** tracks who deleted what and when

### 2. **Version Control**
- **Every survey change creates a new version**
- **Complete history** of all survey modifications
- **Rollback capability** to any previous version
- **Change tracking** with timestamps and user information

### 3. **Template Persistence**
- **System templates** are permanently stored in the database
- **Custom templates** created by users are saved permanently
- **Template sharing** between users with proper permissions
- **Template versioning** for custom templates

### 4. **Enhanced Metadata**
- **Response tracking** with IP addresses and user agents
- **Geographic data** from respondent locations
- **Device information** (mobile/desktop, browser type)
- **Timing data** for response analysis

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Added:
- **`survey_versions`** - Stores all survey versions

## üìã Data Recovery Procedures

### 1. **Recovering Deleted Surveys**

```bash
# 1. List all deleted surveys
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/surveys/deleted

# 2. Restore a specific survey
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/surveys/SURVEY_ID/restore
```

### 2. **Recovering Deleted Templates**

```bash
# 1. List all deleted templates
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/templates/deleted

# 2. Restore a specific template
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/templates/TEMPLATE_ID/restore
```

### 3. **Rolling Back Survey Versions**

```bash
# 1. Get all versions of a survey
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/surveys/SURVEY_ID/versions

# 2. Restore to a specific version
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/surveys/SURVEY_ID/restore-version/VERSION_NUMBER
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection Features

### 1. **Automatic Versioning**
- Every survey edit creates a new version
- No data loss during editing
- Complete audit trail maintained

### 2. **Soft Delete Protection**
- Items marked as deleted but not removed
- Recovery possible at any time
- Audit trail of deletions

### 3. **Permission-Based Access**
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have additional recovery capabilities
- Template sharing with proper permissions

### 4. **Database Constraints**
- Foreign key relationships prevent orphaned data
- Cascade deletes only for permanent deletions
- Data integrity maintained

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. **Database Health Checks**

```sql
-- Check for orphaned data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);

-- Check soft deleted items
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys WHERE is_deleted = true;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM custom_templates WHERE is_deleted = true;

-- Check version counts
SELECT survey_id, COUNT(*) as version_count 
FROM survey_versions 
GROUP BY survey_id 
ORDER BY version_count DESC;
```

### 2. **Cleanup Procedures**

```sql
-- Permanently delete old soft deleted items (after 30 days)
DELETE FROM surveys 
WHERE is_deleted = true 
AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Clean up old versions (keep last 10 versions per survey)
DELETE FROM survey_versions 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT id FROM (
    SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY survey_id ORDER BY version_number DESC) as rn
    FROM survey_versions
  ) t WHERE rn <= 10
);
```

### 3. **Backup Recommendations**

```bash
# Daily backup script
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
pg_dump -h localhost -U username -d surveyguy_db > backup_$DATE.sql
gzip backup_$DATE.sql
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Survey Not Found After "Deletion"**
- Check if survey is soft deleted: `GET /api/surveys/deleted`
- Restore the survey: `POST /api/surveys/:id/restore`

#### 2. **Template Not Available**
- Check if template is soft deleted: `GET /api/templates/deleted`
- Restore the template: `POST /api/templates/:id/restore`

#### 3. **Version History Missing**
- Ensure survey_versions table exists
- Run database migration: `npm run migrate`

#### 4. **Performance Issues**
- Check database indexes are created
- Monitor version table size
- Implement cleanup procedures

## üìà Best Practices

### 1. **Regular Backups**
- Schedule daily database backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Store backups in multiple locations

### 2. **Monitoring**
- Monitor soft deleted item counts
- Track version table growth
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

### 3. **User Training**
- Train users on soft delete vs permanent delete
- Explain version control features
- Document recovery procedures

### 4. **Maintenance**
- Regular cleanup of old soft deleted items
- Archive old survey versions
- Monitor database performance
